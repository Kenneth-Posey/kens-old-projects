Collection of Projects for Code Samples 
=================

##Smokin Goldshop

This is one of my largest projects to date that I worked on over a few years. It was designed to be an all-inclusive order tracking and inventory management system for a real-money-trading website. 

###Technology Used
- jQuery
- Google App Engine
- Python

##TurboKeys

This was my first C# project of any significance, and it was a personal project designed to allow the user to bind mouse movements to hotkeys. The user can then use the interface to easily manage and activate/deactivate the hotkeys available. 

Eventually I planned to add special features with a pay-per-use system tied into a facebook application for managing purchases, but I shelved the project due to lack of time to work.

###Technology Used
- Windows Forms
- C#
- Windows API for controls
